# Description
"""
        XOR-based String Difference Finder

        Algorithm:
        1. Initialize the result to 0.
        2. Iterate through each character in string s and XOR its ASCII value with the result.
        3. Iterate through each character in string t and XOR its ASCII value with the result.
        4. The XOR of both strings cancels out common characters, leaving only the extra character.
        5. Convert the final XOR result back to a character using chr.
        6. Return the added letter.
